NAME
    Dancer2::Template::Obj2HTML - Temnplating system based on HTML::Obj2HTML

SYNOPSYS
    In your config.yml

        engines:
          template:
            Obj2HTML:
              page_loc: "dofiles/pages"
              component_loc: "dofiles/components"
              template_loc: "dofiles/templates"
              extension: ".view"

    In your router:

        template \@content;
        template path/to/file

DESCRIPTION
    Templating system for Dancer2 using HTML::Obj2HTML, primarily intended
    as the target templating system for Dancer2::Plugin::DoFile

    There is very little logic behind this templating system, aside
    processing the templates as Obj2HTML content (i.e. array and hash
    references that define the HTML in an easily manipulatable way).

    Note that the default location for files is in "dofiles/", not
    "layouts/", but a simple configuration change will fix that for you, if
    that's what you want to do. The reason WHY it's "dofiles/" is simply to
    keep together all the Plugin::DoFile and Template::Obj2HTML assets.
